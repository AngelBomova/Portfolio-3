      <div class="col"><h1 class="hthree"> <u>HTML</u> </h1>
        <p class="ptwo">I learned HTML back in my sophomore year of high school in my first Web Design class. Throughout the years, I have gained experience with it and know the ins and outs of it. This is my strongest section of web designing!
        </p>
        <h1 class="hthree"><u>CSS</u></h1>
        <p class="ptwo">You can’t have a GREAT website without making it look pretty and that is where CSS comes to play. I’ve been using CSS the past couple of years in high school, and I use it to make my websites look more visually appealing and functional. I am pretty good at using it to spice things up, and to make themes throughout the whole website.  
        </p>

        <div class="col"><h1 class="hthree"><u>Bootstrap 5</u></h1>
          <p class="ptwo">I learned Bootstrap 5 in the middle of my sophomore year of high school, and I can never go back. It is very useful to make designing easier, and I am pretty efficient with it. Throughout the past 2 years, I have used BS5 to make better structured websites, and this allows me to make them more navigation friendly.
          </p>
          <h1 class="hthree"><u>Javascript</u></h1>
          <p class="ptwo">I started to learn about Javascript near the beginning of my Junior year of high school, and it is so far my newest language. Right now, I could use some work on it, but I have some of the basics down. I do find it really interesting as it can make functions to things, and in a couple years who knows how good I will be with it!
